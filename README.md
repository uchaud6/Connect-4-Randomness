# Connect-4-Randomness
The Java program pits two random players against each other to the goal of seeing the probability of each player winning a game based on 1000 simulations.

Main.java defines an instance of the class Connect4 and runs a simulation of a random game.
Connect4.java contains the class Connect4 which holds the attributes and methods for this project's purpose.

(Work in Progress) There is a bug in the code such that the simulation of a random game does not
run till completition as it only displays the game for a few moves so once this issue is resolved,
we can complete the desired goal of running 1000 simulations and calculating probability.
