# Connect-4-Randomness
The Java program pits two random players against each other to the goal of seeing the probability of each player winning a game based on 1000 simulations.
(Work in Progress)

Main.java defines an instance of the class Connect4 and runs a simulation of a random game.
Connect4.java contains the class Connect4 which holds the attributes and methods for this project's purpose.
